# Conway's Game of Life
 The purpose of this task is to run a version of [Conway's Game of Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life) using Kompics component for each cell.
 
 All the Kompics relevant code is already implemented for you, however, and you only need to fill in the following 4 rules:
 1. Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbours dies, as if caused by under-population.
 2. Any live cell with two or three live neighbours lives on to the next generation.
 3. Any live cell with more than three live neighbours dies, as if by over-population.
 4. Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbours becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.
  
 Implement these rules at the marked position in the code below.
 
 Note that while this is a graded assignment, there are no tests and the assignment always passes automatically.
 The purpose is merely for you to experiment with the zeppelin environment and familiarise yourself with the assignment submission procedure.
 
 Once you have the basic version working, feel free to experiment with different initial state generators, and numbers of generations.
