Some components such as `PerfectLink`,  `Network` and `Timer` are already provided. No need to implement them.\n2. Execute the imports defined below **before** compiling your component implementations.\n3. We recommend making use of the component state and internal messages we have provided, if any, to complete the implementation logic.\n4.

Remember that during the simulation check you can print and observe the simulation time, i.e. with `System.currentTimeMillis()`.\n5. Do not forget to run the checker code block after each component implementation to ensure that all properties are satisfied before exporting and submitting the notebook.\n6.
